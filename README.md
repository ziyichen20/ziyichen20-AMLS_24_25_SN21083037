# Project Overview
This project is designed to evaluate and compare the performance of CNN and ResNet architectures on medical imaging datasets, specifically BreastMNIST and BloodMNIST. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of different architectures in medical classification tasks, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses.
